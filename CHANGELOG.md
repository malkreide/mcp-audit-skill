## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Rule 3 now draws the line against transport and authorization failures.** The
  rule listed four causes for zero hits, all of them query-level — absent term,
  too narrow a query, restricted scope, wrong syntax. A rejected request is none
  of them: measured case, a request carrying a foreign Host header comes back as
  HTTP 421 with the body `Invalid Host header`, and a layer that only asks "any
  records?" passes that through as an empty set. The hint it then attaches — try
  a wildcard, widen the fields — points away from the actual fix, so a
  configuration error undercuts the very rule that exists to prevent guessing.
  Rule 6 already made this distinction for schema drift, but a request turned away
  at the transport never reaches the parsing layer. One paragraph and one
  checklist item in `SKILL.md`, one sentence on the rule-3 line in both READMEs.
  No new rule.

- **Rule 5 now names the mock-free variant of the same failure.** A regression
  test in `mcp-transport-hardening` set the environment variable whose *absence*
  was the actual subject under test, so it passed with a deliberately introduced
  fault in place. Independent confirmation from a different domain — transport
  security rather than data fidelity — of what rule 5 already said about mocks:
  a test that establishes the condition under which the fault cannot occur
  checks nothing. Two sentences, no new rule.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-01

Documentation and guards. No rule added, changed or removed — six rules, as in
1.0.0. What changes is that the skill names its place in the family, and that two
figures nothing used to check now have something behind them: the reference file
can no longer drift from the rules it claims to cover, and the version badge can
no longer drift from this file.
### Added

- **The related-skills tables now name all five skills in one order** — builder,
  probe, fidelity, transport-hardening, audit — in `SKILL.md` and both READMEs, so
  the family reads the same way from every repository in it. The new
  [`mcp-transport-hardening`](https://github.com/malkreide/mcp-transport-hardening-skill)
  sits *next to* this skill rather than under it: this one asks whether the answer
  contains what the source holds, that one whether an answer arrives at all. Same
  silent class, one layer down.

  `mcp-builder` is described as Anthropic's without a licence claim:
  `anthropics/skills` carries no LICENSE file and the API reports none, so stating
  one would be a guess in a public README. `termdat-mcp` moved out of the table
  into a sentence below it — it is the server the rules came from, not a skill of
  the family, and in a table of roles it read as if it were.

- Contributing section in both READMEs. It states the bar a new rule has to
  clear: the incident it came from, a counter-example pair, and its Nachweis.
  The skill's own subject applies to the proposal — evidence that comes only from
  a mock is not yet evidence.

### Changed

- **CI checks the version badge against the CHANGELOG.** It was the last figure
  in the README with nothing behind it, and it is the one most likely to be
  forgotten: the release is cut, the badge stays. In `mcp-audit-skill` it sat
  three releases behind before anyone noticed.

  Source is the topmost `## [X.Y.Z]` heading — `[Unreleased]` carries no version
  and is skipped by the pattern. The READMEs come from `glob("README*.md")`
  rather than a maintained list, so a third language is covered automatically.
  Both anchors are asserted separately: a CHANGELOG without a release heading and
  a README without a badge each fail, because a check that finds nothing is green.

  Mutation-tested four ways. One of them changed the design: removing the topmost
  release heading does not report a missing anchor, it silently falls back to the
  next release and blames the badge. The check still goes red, but the diagnosis
  pointed at the wrong file — so the failure message now names the CHANGELOG line
  it derived the expected version from, and says that either side may have moved.

- **CI now checks `reference/patterns.py` for content, not just syntax.** Until
  now it was verified to exist and to compile; its two claims — the number word
  in the module docstring and that every rule actually appears — were guarded by
  nothing. Both happened to be correct, which is the least reliable reason for a
  value to be right: `mcp-data-source-probe-skill` described this skill as "five
  rules" for two weeks after the sixth was added, for exactly that reason.

  The rule-count step now covers the file as well: the docstring word against the
  count in `SKILL.md`, and the set of rules mentioned (`Rule 1`, `Rules 4 + 5` —
  ranges expanded) against the set that exists. A rule without a pattern is a rule
  nobody can copy, so a gap fails the build.

  Verified against mutations rather than a green run: a wrong docstring word, a
  reworded anchor phrase, and a rule with every mention removed each fail with a
  message naming the problem.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-01

First standalone release. The skill was previously distributed as
`companion/mcp-data-fidelity/` inside
[`mcp-data-source-probe-skill`](https://github.com/malkreide/mcp-data-source-probe-skill);
this repository makes it the canonical home. The skill content is unchanged from
that copy — packaging only.

### Added

- **Rule 1 — send scope parameters explicitly, never inherit them.** An omitted
  optional filter frequently means an arbitrary slice rather than "unrestricted".
  The fact lives only in the spec's parameter description — not in the response
  schema, not in the documentation example, and not visible from a working call.
  With the table of the usual suspects (CKAN `rows`, WFS `maxFeatures`, SPARQL
  named graphs, Elasticsearch `size`, GraphQL `first`, TERMDAT
  `ClassificationIds`) and the two-call recall delta that proves it.
- **Rule 2 — send parameter groups in full.** Members of a group that are not
  sent keep their server-side default, so the argument can widen but never
  narrow — a no-op that looks like control.
- **Rule 3 — an empty result carries a next step.** Zero hits are ambiguous
  between absent term, too narrow a query, restricted scope, and wrong syntax.
  The `hint` belongs in the tool result, not in the README, because the README is
  not handed to the model.
- **Rule 4 — the tool description is a hallucination surface.** The
  counter-intuitive one: a phrasing that explains an empty result causes
  confabulation more reliably than no phrasing at all. A caveat must ask for a
  retry, never license a conclusion.
- **Rule 5 — query syntax in the description, recall in the tests.** Query
  language plus matching granularity, since whole-word indexes make German
  compounds unfindable from their parts. Recall guarded by live floors rather
  than exact counts, because a test that cries wolf gets switched off.
- **Rule 6 — confirm the response shape before counting it.** Rules 1–5 cover
  what the server *sends* and what it *tells* the model; rule 6 covers what it
  *reads*. `payload.get("servers", [])` turns an upstream shape change into a
  valid-looking empty result — the same confabulation surface as rule 3, one
  layer down. A schema mismatch belongs in the error channel.
- **`reference/patterns.py`** — copy-paste FastMCP / httpx / pydantic v2
  patterns for all six rules, including the `rows_of()` guard, which deliberately
  checks only the envelope and the fields the caller actually reads rather than
  validating a full schema.
- **Release checklist** for a data-querying tool, in `SKILL.md`.
- Bilingual README (EN/DE) with a Security section stating the two deliberate
  limits: the best-effort scope widening in rule 1, which narrows recall rather
  than failing the call when the vocabulary endpoint is unreachable, and the
  `rows_of()` guard in rule 6, which validates the envelope and the fields
  actually read rather than the full schema.

### Context

Rules 1–5 come from a single real incident:
[`termdat-mcp#11`](https://github.com/malkreide/termdat-mcp/issues/11). The
server sent `ClassificationIds` only when the caller supplied them; the upstream
API restricts an ID-less search to one of 23 classifications. Searching for
"Quellensteuer" returned nothing despite several matching entries — past 33 green
offline tests and a passed 68-check audit.

Rule 6 comes from a second case: an MCP Registry query returned nothing for a
while because the fields sit under `servers[].server.*` and the client looked one
level up. Syntactically fine, semantically blind.
